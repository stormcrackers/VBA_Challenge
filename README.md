There are three screeshots of the sheets after I ran the code. I also included the code as a separate file in the git hub so that I didn't need to upload the very large excel file. 

I recieved help on this challege from one of the TAs, Limei Hou in a tutoring session. I had the logic of the challenge correct but she helped me with the actual coding.
